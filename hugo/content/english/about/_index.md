### Business dedicated to managing data

Our company was founded in 2020 to integrate complex data. Transforming data is all that we do: we develop robust software to consolidate data, we implement it rigorously and we provide first class support.

We are a sole-proprietorship, but we access to a broad network of freelancers which share the same data spirit. This gives us the freedom to make decisions in the long-term interest of the company. 

We help many leading companies to keep control of their data. As we are focussing on data integration since the beginning, we have a great knowledge of anything that involves data.

www.data-integration.services is owned by ETLBox Office (Andreas Lennartz).
