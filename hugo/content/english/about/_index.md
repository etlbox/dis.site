### Business dedicated to managing data

Our company was founded to make data and API integration easy for our customers. Transforming data is all that we do: we develop robust software to consolidate data, we implement it rigorously and we provide first class support.

We are a sole-proprietorship, founded by Andreas Lennartz ({{< link-ext text="see his profile on LinkedIn" url="(https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreaslennartz/" >}}). Andreas has a very profound knowledge of anything related to data and IT, and has access to a broad network of freelancers which share the same data spirit. This gives us the freedom to make decisions in the long-term interest of the company.  

We help many leading companies to keep control of their data. Our customers are spread across the world and areas - and ranges from world wide operation non-profit organisations over medium sized medical companies to small consulting companies. As we are focussing on data integration since the beginning, we have a great knowledge of anything that involves data, and can share this knowledge to all companies of all sizes and areas.
