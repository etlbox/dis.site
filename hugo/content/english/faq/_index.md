{{< faq "How can I test your service?" >}}
We offer you to create a Proof of Concept for free. This will be free of charges, and gives you to ability to test if our service works as expected. We would kindly ask to give us access up to 5 of your API endpoints / databases entities, preferably containing test data. If this is not possible, we can also create some mock endpoints or fake tables that simulate your API. 
{{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "What does 'up to 5 endpoints or entities' mean?" >}}
An endpoint could be anything like a REST API Uri (e.g. "test.com/orders/get"), a simple HTTP GET call or a SOAP request. As an entity we consider a table in a relational database or a document container in a document database. If the database does support custom queries, an entity could also be the result of a Sql statement.

{{< faq "What if my endpoints/entities contain more data?" >}}
If your endpoint or entity exceeds the agreed amount of data records, this won't be a problem - our service is always designed to work with a higher amount of data. But we want to make sure that there won't be a performance issue with your integration. In our SaaS solution, we monitor the processed number of data records and track the time needed for the transfer. If the integration service does show delays due to the data size, we will get in touch with you and discuss possible performance improvements.

{{< faq "What does unlimited transformations mean?" >}}
When creating the integration code, we create as many data transformations as you like. A transformation can be everything - a data quality check, some data lookup, aggregation, cleansing, data enrichment ... If it can be coded, we normally can implement it. Of course, if the requirements change, we can adapt the transformation to your needs. For minor changes (e.g. adding a new field), the costs for adapting to the new requirements is included in our service fee.

{{< faq "How are your prices calculated?" >}}
Our pricing for our service is based on two factors: The number of endpoints/entities and the number of records for each endpoint/entity. 
When using our service, you can always adjust the pricing to the actual number of connected endpoints/entities.

{{< faq "How can I terminate my contract?" >}}
You can always quit using our service - overpaid amounts will be refunded. We aim to get money for providing a good service, and we are convinced that once you choose us you will stay our customer. But if you decide that you don't need our service anymore or simply aren't happy with us, you can always terminate the contract.
